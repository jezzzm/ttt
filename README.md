# ttt: Tic Tac Toe (Project_0 @ GA Sydney)

ttt is the shorthand name for my first project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. Shoutout to SEi34 @ GA Sydney!

The primary aim for this project is to deliver an online-hosted, playable Tic Tac Toe game for two players, built from scratch. Feel free to [check out my version!](https://jezzzm.github.io/ttt/)

## Minimum Requirements
* Board rendered in browser with switching player turns
* Display of game result
* HTML, CSS, and JS files
* Online deployment
* Semantic markup

## Design Objectives
In addition to meeting the minimum requirements, I set myself some objectives, primarily to optimise user experience of the site.

* Fully responsive without media queries - utilise modern CSS display methods (grid + flexbox)
* No third party JS dependencies
	* To ensure lightweight site with minimal ‘fluff'
* Highly readable text
* Clear interactive elements
* Option for human versus computer mode
* Adjustable  3x3 -> n x n board size
	* Computer player still functional but certainly less artificial intelligence and more random as size increases
* Developer-friendly codebase including:
	* Separation of AI, UI and game logic scripts
	* Tastefully commented code
	* Regular and communicative commits
	* As DRY as my fledgling capabilities permit

## Technologies Utilised
* Vanilla JavaScript
* CSS3
* HTML5
* [water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) for base styling

## Getting Started
